Modules
-------
Main advantage of jSh is it modularity to adapt it to other modules developed by other developpers.

All built-in and especially commands are coded into dynamics libraries, what allow to develop more personnals built-in by users.

By Including personnals built-in, you allow to trust about jSh.

A packet manager is included 'jmanager' to install some built-in developed by community. (developpment in progess) 

Library
------
For this project, I used some Glibc library as "dl" and oter libs like curl and "NXJSON" to read servlet's result.

For the moment, you have to download only curl by typping "apt-get install curl" (Debian/Ubuntu) or "yum install curl" (Fedora/CentOS/RedHat) or by compiling yourself sources : http://curl.haxx.se/download.html
